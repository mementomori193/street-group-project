### Street Group Project

This is just an empty laravel project

To get the output go into a terminal type:
```
php artisan homeowners:import
```

this will print out the array of homeowners extracted from the provided
csv which should have been included in the git project, but if not, 
should go into `storage/app/private/homeowners.csv`
